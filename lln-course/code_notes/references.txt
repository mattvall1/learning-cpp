References
* Aliases to existing variables
* Same syntax as references var
* NOT POINTERS, OBJECTS, OR VARIABLES
* Do not have an address
  * No arrays of references - to index an element in an array, you need an address
  * No pointers to references
  * No references to references - Possible to write, but will both reference initial var

Useful applications of references
* Passing parameters by reference
  * Modify variable sent as an argument within function
  * Avoid copying large objects as function parameters
    * Passing variables COPIES the data
  * Same applies to 'for' loops
