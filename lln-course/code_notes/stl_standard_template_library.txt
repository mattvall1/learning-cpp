The Standard Template Library (STL)
* A set of template classes
* Generic programming - Code written in type independent way
* Included in C++ Standard Library
* Enables efficient + reusable code

Components of C++ STL
1. Containers
Array-like data structures storing collections of objects (i.e. Vectors, Stacks, Queues)

2. Iterators
Pointer-like objects allowing traversal of containers

3. Algorithms
Collection of algorithms for operations like search/sort/count/modify etc

4. Functor (or Function objects)
Function objects that can be parameterized in their constructors
#include <functional>
