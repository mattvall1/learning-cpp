Generic Programming
* A paradigm where data types are not specified in the implementation of code, but rather in its use.


Also known as Compile-Time Polymorphism
* Specifying data types at variable definition, or object instantiation is in essence polymorphism resolved at compile time
* Could be more efficient than runtime polymorphism because most calculations/adaptations happen once when app is being built


Templates
* Same idea as Word/PowerPoint templates
