Identifiers
Valid characters:
* Letters (a-z, A-Z)
* Digits (0-9)
* Underscores

Identifiers cannot begin with a number
player_img_1, playerImg1 - These are valid

Must not match reserved words - just like any other language. I.e. int, float, char...
C++ is case sensitive - but do not abuse this as likely will make mistakes!
* x != X
* var_name != VAR_NAME != Var_Name

Generally keep variables less than 31 chars - for compatibility with old system
Don't use non-Latin chars - should only use letters, numbers, underscores
Try not to use underscores at the start of var names unless private variables etc
